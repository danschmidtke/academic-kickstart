summary: "Many words in English are morphologically complex (*assign*-*ment*, *teach*-*er*) and so being able to proficiently apply the correct endings (suffixes) to complex words is an important skill to acquire. In this project, we analyzed the written production of English language learners and asked *What are the statistical properties that make morphologically complex words easier for EFL students to learn?*  This project was published in [Applied Psycholinguistics](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0142716422000182)."

This project found that complex word production among English language learners is best explained as a function of their **learning and exploitation** of the **distributional properties** of the morphological structure of words.

Certain suffixes, like *-ion* in *permission*, occur more frequently in written language than others. Certain stems like *produce* can connect to many different suffixes: *producer*, *production*, *reproduce*, *reproducer*, *reproducibility* etc. We analyzed written production of 196 EFL students and tracked their development over time. We wanted to see if these distributional features had an impact on how they were able to learn complex words. 

In addition to discovering that **suffix frequency** and **morphological family size** are important pieces of information for EFL students, we also found that, **EFL students were better at applying the correct suffix type to stems** by the end of the study duration (e.g.,*humanity*; *human* + *ity*), and **made fewer morpheme substitution errors**: when an incorrect suffix was applied to the stem form (e.g., *humanable*, *human* + *able*).
