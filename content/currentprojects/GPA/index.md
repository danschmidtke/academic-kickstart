summary: "Does growth during an English bridging program benefit future academic flourishing? In this study we found that change in reading speed of passages of text, measured using the eye-tracking methodology, was a significant predictor of grade point average up to 3 years after the completion of the bridging program. Larger gains in reading speed are linked to higher GPAs."
