Does it matter how much you read during an English language bridging program? The answer is that it might help you become a faster reader over time. This work was done together with Dr. Anna Moro and Sadaf Rahmanian. We conducted a longitudinal study which looked at how often bridging program students read. We collected data from 150 students, asking them how much text thy read and for how long.
