My primary research interest is in reading development and experimental psycholinguistics. I use a variety of tools, including eye-tracking and quantitative linguistic methods, to delve into how linguistic, cognitive, and experiential factors influence reading behavior. 

My current research focus is on individual differences in the development of reading skill among international students who use English as an additional language. This SSHRC-funded research project examines longitudinal change in reading skills among international students enrolled in McMaster University's pre-sessional English for academic purposes (EAP) programs. 

As Mohawk College's College Student Success Innovation Centre (CSSIC) Research Fellow I am investigating literacy development among international students enrolled in Mohawk Collegeâ€™s EAP program. This research project will involve implementing and testing a targeted reading intervention which is aimed at enriching the academic English skills of international students at Mohawk College. You can read more about CSSIC and this project [here](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/college-student-success-innovation-centre/cssic-research-fellow).

My research delves into how linguistic, cognitive, and experiential factors influence reading behavior. I use a variety of experimental methods (e.g., eye-tracking, corpus linguistics) and statistical tools to study how reading skill is shaped by individual cognitive and linguistic abilities. Within this larger framework, my research is dedicated to moving beyond studying the linguistic behaviour of <em>WEIRD</em> (<em>Western</em>, <em>Educated</em>, <em>Industrialized</em>, <em>Rich</em>, and <em>Democratic</em>) populations. Examples of this research include eye-movement studies of reading in non-college bound adults and corpus studies of linguistic phenomena across varieties of English. My current research uses eye-tracking to understand English reading development of ESL students enrolled in an academic bridging program.
