I have taught the following courses at McMaster University:

### Laboratory in Experimental Linguistics
(2023, 2025). In this course students collaborate to plan, carrying out, analyze and report an experiment that addresses a cognitive aspect of language processing.


### Statistics for Language Research 
(2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022). An introductory course to statistical methods custom-tailored to the needs of language researchers. This course provides an introduction to <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

### Computers and Linguistic Analysis
(2018, 2020, 2021, 2024). This course studies computational tools and techniques of language processing using large electronic collections of texts. Students are trained in basic text-processing, statistical and programming skills using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>.

### The Art of Leadership
(2017). This course offers senior undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in a learning-centred leadership program, involving peer-to-peer mentoring of students in the MELD program. The course provides up-front and on-going training and development in active leadership and mentorship.
